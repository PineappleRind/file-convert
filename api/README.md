# file-convert-api
REST API to convert between file formats using FFMPEG

## Prerequisites
- make sure you have **FFMPEG** to be able to convert stuff
- `bun i` / `npm i` / `yarn i` / `pnpm i` to install dependencies

## Running
- ../run_api.sh to run api
- It's important that it's run from the enclosing folder (`file-convert`), the code relies on this fact (i probably should change that)
